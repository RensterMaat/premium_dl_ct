# premium_dl_ct
Deep learning on CT imaging to predict response to checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma


# todo
- augmentation
    - rotation to all possible directions
    - shear/scale/translations
    - gaussian noise
    - consider intensity and contrast enhancement
- inner cross validation
- run grid search
- inference using ensembling per inner fold

# nice to have
- multiple instance learning
- adaptive batch size
